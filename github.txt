- Go to the GitHub repository you want to clone. You can search for repositories using the search bar on GitHub.
- On the repository's page, click on the "Code" button.
- Copy the URL of the repository. It should look something like: https://github.com/username/repository-name.git.
- Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. You can use the cd command to change directories.
- Once you're in the desired directory, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL you copied earlier. For example:
"git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git"
- Replace "https://github.com/username/repository-name.git" with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.
- Press Enter. Git will clone the repository to your local machine.
